## Introduction

This short post reveals the short commands for capturing the filepath to a file in Finder. The source is the [stackexchange post on Mac Finder: Getting the path of a directory or file as as string](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/252171/mac-finder-getting-the-path-of-a-directory-or-file-as-as-string).

Just click the following three keys simultaneously to get the full path to the clipboard:


[alt]+[cmd]+[c]
or
[opt]+[cmd]+[c]

where opt and alt is the same key (with the two legged fork), and cmd is the apple special "castle" key.
